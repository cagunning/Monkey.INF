LUKE 

Alas, poor stormtrooper, I knew ye not,
Yet have I ta’en both uniform and life
From thee. What manner of a man wert thou?
A man of inf’nite jest or cruelty?
A man is nothing without his morning coffee!
Has thee had though cup of bean water yet??
or is yee lacking from thirs? 
A man with helpmate and with children too?
A man who hath his Empire serv’d with pride?
